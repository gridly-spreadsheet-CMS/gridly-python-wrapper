# Gridly Python Wrapper

This script can help you import & export the data from Gridly to file formats that are not supported by Gridly. Currently, we support only XML and JSON file format.

Please make sure your file is in the right file format, otherwise you need to customize it with a few lines of code.

# Installation

The scripts are written in python 3.8. So it's best to install this version or later one.

Run below command to install package dependencies:

```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

Before running the below commands. Please setup the configuration under config/ folder.

- scripts.yml: contains configurations used by script itself. We only need to set *"gridly-url"*. Others can leave as default.
- setup.yml: contains configurations for working with data both *import* and *export*.
  Please update the "api-key", "view-id", mappings between "file" and "column-id" and export/import directory. Other can leave as default.

Followings are available options to work with gridly apis

Import:

```console
$ python main.py -o import
```

Export:

```console
$ python main.py -o export
```

# Python module

This script has 5 main modules, namely:

- **main&#46;py:** The main module that processes import/export command line.
- **utils&#46;py:** The utilities module that read or write the data of the file or the grid based on your needs.
- **strategy&#46;py:** The strategy module that contains import/export class to map your file with the grid based on your needs.
- **_import&#46;py:** The import module that import your file(s) to the grid after it validated your setup.yml file.
- **_export&#46;py:** The export module that export the data to your file after it validated your setup.yml file.

# Customization

## Basic case

You can convert your file format to xml/json file format before you run the import/export command line.

### Example

In case you want to import data from a PO file into Gridly, you can convert it to a JSON file to match with Gridly Python . After that, you can continue to use the available commands to import data into Gridly as above.

Firstly, you read the PO file as a tuple:

```
def getFile(locale, path):
  return path + locale + ".po"

def extractPOFile(poPath):
  with open(poPath, 'r', encoding="utf8") as f:
    tuples = re.findall(r'msgid "(.+)"\nmsgstr "(.+)"', f.read())
  return tuples
```

Next, you map the data inside the tuple to a json file structure of your choice and dump it into a json file:

```
def POtoJSON(locales, path):
  obj = {}
  for locale in locales:
    obj[locale] = {}
    tuples = extractPOFile( getFile(locale, path) )
    for tuple in tuples:
      obj[locale][tuple[0]] = tuple[1]

  with open('/content/sample_data/vi_VN.json', "w", encoding="utf8") as write_file:
        json.dump(obj, write_file, ensure_ascii=False)
```

Next, run the script and get the JSON file you want:

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
  locales = ["vi_VN"]
  path = "/content/sample_data/"
  print(POtoJSON(locales, path))
```

Finally, run Gridly Python Wrapper import command to import data into Gridly:

```
$ python main.py -o import
```

## Advance case

If you want to import/export a file that is not xml or json format, you have to add some code lines in **utils&#46;py**, **strategy&#46;py**, **_import&#46;py**, and **_export&#46;py**. In case you want to import data from a PO file into Gridly, you can follow the following instructions, then execute the available command to import data into Gridly:

- **utils&#46;py:** Please add the new read/write function of your file format here. Currently, we support only xml/json file format.

```
# Read PO file function
def load_po_file(file_path): 
    """
        load po file
    """
    pofile = polib.pofile(file_path)
    return pofile
```

- **strategy&#46;py:** You can add the new import/export strategy in this module. You should use list or dictionary format for your data to fit to all modules.

```
# Base class for PoImportStrategy
class PoImportStrategy(ABC):
    def read(self, column_id, obj: Dict, previous_path=''):
        records = []
        self.extract(records, column_id, obj, previous_path)
        return records
        
    @abstractmethod
    def extract(self, records, column_id, obj: Dict, previous_path=''):
        pass

class DefaultPoImportStrategy(PoImportStrategy):
    def extract(self, records: List, column_id, obj: Dict, previous_path=''):
        if isinstance(obj, dict):
            for key, value in obj.items():
                path = f"{key}"
                self.extract(records, column_id, value, path)
        elif isinstance(obj, list):
            for i, value in enumerate(obj):
                path = f"{i}"
                self.extract(records, column_id, value, path)   
```

- **_import&#46;py:** You need to customize some functions in import_data function and add the new file format to some conditions.

```
# Import PO strategy function
DEFAULT_PO_IMPORT_STRATEGY = strategy.DefaultPoImportStrategy()
```

```
# Check PO file format
elif '.po' in file.name:
  # Read and Import  Po file
  data = utils.load_po_file(f"{import_directory}/{file_name}")
              dict = {}
              for entry in data:
                  key = entry.msgid 
                  value = entry.msgstr
                  dict[key] = value

              file_mapping = __get_file_mapping(file_name, file_mappings)
              if file_mapping is None:
                  return

              extracted_records = DEFAULT_PO_IMPORT_STRATEGY.read(file_mapping['column-id'], dict, '')
```
